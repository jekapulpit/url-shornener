## Retrospective
What went well?

* I did a big job with link generating and avoiding collisions
* I prepared a good base for statistics reports by collecting a lot of user's data 

What didnâ€™t go well?

* I faced an issue in a geocoding gem. Default workers were executing without necessary parameters.

Also, I added B-tree indexes and tested database performance with 'explain analyze'. It works great with 1000000+ rows (search query takes about 0.2ms).   

If I had more time to work on this, I would go into a report with more detailed statistics (with charts, maps, etc.).
